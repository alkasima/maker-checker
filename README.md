# maker-checker
 
Maker Checker is a laravel 8 api the system resolves around the idea that for any change to be made to user information by an administrator, it must be approved by a fellow administrator in order to take effect; and if the request is declined, the change isn't persisted.

The system is using laravel passport authentication.
